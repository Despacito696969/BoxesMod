Basically HappyDays' grid challenge, but as a mod and configurable.
WARNING: It doesn't support multiplayer.

You start in a single rectangular box that you cannot escape. You can buy a neighbouring box, but the more boxes you buy the more they cost.
To buy boxes you need to use the Box Buying Interface, which is crafted for free.

You can configure box size, base cost, cost increase and boxes per cost increase.

Also might have buggy collisions in some funny cases, because I couldn't find a good way to do collision resolution with just the tModLoader hooks.
